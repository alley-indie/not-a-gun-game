YOU!
Are you living under a rock?
Earth is being attacked by fucking aliens!
you need to do something before it's too late.

...
No, our weapond don't work against them, otherwise we wouldn't need your help.

Here!
Takes this 'ungun' that i just created, it'll will 'unshoot' the bullets the aliens used agains us, and kill them.
How it works? You just select the bullet you want to unshoot, making sure there's an enemy intersecting you and the bullet, and just unshoot. It's pretty simple, even you can use it without any problems.
let's go, rise and shine."
